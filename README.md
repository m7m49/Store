This is a simple __CRUD__ project.

The website is an E-store where the users or the guests of the website see the available products,
and the shop manager can log in to the website and edit, delete, or add products.

### The project includes 4 main pages:

* The home page (products page) where all the available products are displayed.
* The About page, which should contain some information about the store. (Currently, the About page is empty).
* The contact page, which should contain the information about contacting the store manager. (Currently, it's empty).
* The login page, which includes a login form so that the admin can access the store as an admin and edit the products.

There are other pages for updating the existing products or adding new products. 
These pages are displayed only for the shop manager.

The authentication information (the admin email and the password) is hardcoded inside the source code files. 
This is not the appropriate way to do this and it leads to security vulnerabilities. But, I did it like this
since the current information is not important and I think it does not lead to real security risks for this project.]

### The technologies that I used in this project:
* For the front-end development, I used Tailwind (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
* For the back-end development, I used PHP.
* For the database development, I used MySQL.
